  <h5><b>The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination under Endogenous Product Offerings: the Case of Implantable Medical Devices</b> (<em>coming soon</em>)
<details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">The lack of price transparency in the medical device industry causes a large variation  in prices paid for the same product between hospitals. In this paper, I use the context of a type of implantable medical device known as Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) to analyze the welfare effects of market segmentation, or third-degree price discrimination, when manufacturers' product offerings are endogenous. My results show that when manufacturers are not allowed to third degree price discriminate, prices are higher on average, as manufacturers tend to price products to their inelastic markets. However, they indirectly price discriminate by delaying the exit of some of their older, cheaper products. As a result of 1) increased product variety and 2) the competition effect of a rival's additional product, hospital surplus under uniform pricing can increase by up to 3.4% relative to the price discrimination case. This, however, comes at a cost to patients; the purchase of ICDs equipped with a superior technology drops by up to 26.3%. </font></p></details>

<details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">Following the introduction of universal access to free medicines
and diagnostics at public health facilities in Rajasthan during 2011â€“13, we revisited the facilities surveyed by Banerjee et al (2004), and present the changes over the last decade. We find substantial improvement in infrastructure and the patient utilisation rate, but abysmally low utilisation of facilities primarily due to high absenteeism. We also present
findings from fieldwork in Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand to bring out striking contrasts among these four northern states.</font></p></details>
