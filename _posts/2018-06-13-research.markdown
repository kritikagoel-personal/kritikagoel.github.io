  <h5><b>The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination under Endogenous Product Offerings: the Case of Implantable Medical Devices</b> (<em>coming soon</em>)
 <details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">Implantable medical device manufacturers are able to segment their markets (third-degree price discriminate) by setting different prices for the same product in different hospitals. I use the context of a type of implantable medical device known as Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) to analyze the welfare effects of market segmentation, allowing manufacturers' product offerings to be endogenously determined. My results show that under a uniform pricing policy, prices are higher on average, as manufacturers tend to price products to their inelastic consumers. However, they indirectly segment their markets by delaying the exit of some of their older, cheaper products, and targeting them to their elastic consumers. As a result of 1) increased product variety and 2) the competition effect of a rival's additional product, hospital surplus under uniform pricing can increase by up to 3.4% relative to the price discrimination case. However, the purchase of ICDs equipped with a superior technology drops by up to 26.3%.</font></p></details>

 <h5><b>Drug acquisitions and firm efficiencies in marketing</b> (with <em>Motaz Al-Chanati</em>), 
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2"> We document novel evidence on an important source of efficiency from drug acquisitions: access to the marketing networks of an acquiring firm. A common marketing practice employed by pharmaceutical companies is known as physician detailing: it involves food and beverage transfers by companies' sales representatives to physicians. We use detailed data from 2014-2018 on physician detailing, and 13 drug acquisitions by 11 firms in 2015-2016 to document three facts: First, physician detailing for a drug increases after its acquisition. Second, physicians that were already receiving detailing payments for the other drugs of the acquiring firm are disproportionately more likely to receive these payments for the acquired drug after its acquisition. Third, physicians that receive detailing payments for a drug are more likely to prescribe it. Our results suggest that firms leverage their existing physician-sales representative networks to derive marketing efficiencies after acquiring a drug. </font></p></details>

  <h5><b>Public Health Facilities in North India: An Exploratory Study in Four States</b> (<a href="/files/epw_paper.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Link</em></a>) , (with <em>Reetika Khera</em>),  
<em>Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 50, Issue No. 21, 23 May, 2015</em>
<details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">Following the introduction of universal access to free medicines
and diagnostics at public health facilities in Rajasthan during 2011â€“13, we revisited the facilities surveyed by Banerjee et al (2004), and present the changes over the last decade. We find substantial improvement in infrastructure and the patient utilisation rate, but abysmally low utilisation of facilities primarily due to high absenteeism. We also present
findings from fieldwork in Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand to bring out striking contrasts among these four northern states.</font></p></details>
