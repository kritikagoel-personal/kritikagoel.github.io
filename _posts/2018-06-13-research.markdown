  <h5><b>The Welfare Effects of Price Discrimination under Endogenous Product Offerings: the Case of Implantable Medical Devices</b> (<em>coming soon</em>)
 <details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">Implantable medical device manufacturers are able to segment their markets (third-degree price discriminate) by setting different prices for the same product in different hospitals. I use the context of a type of implantable medical device known as Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) to analyze the welfare effects of market segmentation, allowing manufacturers' product offerings to be endogenously determined. My results show that under a uniform pricing policy, prices are higher on average, as manufacturers tend to price products to their inelastic consumers. However, they indirectly segment their markets by delaying the exit of some of their older, cheaper products, and targeting them to their elastic consumers. As a result of 1) increased product variety and 2) the competition effect of a rival's additional product, hospital surplus under uniform pricing can increase by up to 3.4\% relative to the price discrimination case. However, the purchase of ICDs equipped with a superior technology drops by up to 26.3\%.</font></p></details>

 <h5><b>Drug acquisitions and firm efficiencies in marketing</b> (with <em>Motaz Al-Chanati</em>), 
  <details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">In this project, we document novel evidence on a source of efficiency from drug acquisitions: access to the sales representative networks of the acquiring firm. We use the context of 13 drug acquisitions by 11 firms from 2015-2016 to document three facts: First, compared to other drugs in the same class as an acquired drug, physician detailing for a drug goes up after it is acquired. Second, after an acquisition, physicians that were already being marketed to for the other drugs of the acquirer are disproportionately more likely to be marketed to for the acquired drug.  Third, an increase in physician detailing for a drug after an acquisition is associated with an increase in its prescriptions.  </font></p></details>

  <h5><b>Public Health Facilities in North India: An Exploratory Study in Four States</b> (<a href="/files/epw_paper.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Link</em></a>) , (with <em>Reetika Khera</em>),  
<em>Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 50, Issue No. 21, 23 May, 2015</em>
<details><summary>Abstract:</summary><p><font size="2">Following the introduction of universal access to free medicines
and diagnostics at public health facilities in Rajasthan during 2011â€“13, we revisited the facilities surveyed by Banerjee et al (2004), and present the changes over the last decade. We find substantial improvement in infrastructure and the patient utilisation rate, but abysmally low utilisation of facilities primarily due to high absenteeism. We also present
findings from fieldwork in Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand to bring out striking contrasts among these four northern states.</font></p></details>
